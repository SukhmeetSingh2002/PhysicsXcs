# Go Experiments

This project is a collection of experiments conducted using the Go programming language. It consists of two main parts:

1. Reaction Diffusion Algorithm: An implementation of the reaction-diffusion algorithm, which is used to simulate the process of diffusion and chemical reactions. It can create various patterns with minor changes in the parameters.

2. Signal Analysis: A set of functions for signal analysis, including Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and its parallel implementation. 

Each part of the project has its own README file with more detailed information. Feel free to explore and experiment with the code.
